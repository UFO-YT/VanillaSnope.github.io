            I use a One by Wacom tablet (I hope to upgrade to a Wacom intuos Pro Large soon!) and Flash for all of my illustrations, animations, drawings, ect. I have always used Flash and don't plan to use different software. It's really intuitive, powerful, and overall a great program. I also don't plan on using any other tablets than Wacoms, as they are high quality and have never failed me.

            Where I began
        </h1>
        <p>
            Sometime in 4th or 5th grade I got intrigued in hand drawn, frame-by-frame animation. I don't remember how, but I would guess it was from animations that I'd find on the internet such as Hellbenders, Salad Fingers, Eddsworld, and more. So I did some research and started making my own animations. I was only eleven then. I used FlipaClip on my Amazon Fire tablet then to animate. I was horrible at animating then. But I was so devoted to do animation that I kept doing it. I started studying the 12 principles of animation uploaded by alanbeckertutorials. Thanks to him I was able to learn animation and get a head start from just trial and error. Edventually, by 6th grade I already outgrew FlipaClip and needed a new program. I wanted to make bigger, better, and more impressive animations. So I got Flash and started using it on my PC. However, I had to draw with my mouse and that was a huge problem. So I learnt about graphics tablets and saved up from one. I earned enough money by babysitting to buy a One by Wacom tablet. With my graphics tablet and flash, I started making animations. I had no idea how to use the program then or how to look at my monitor without looking at the tablet while drawing. It was extremely difficult, but through experience and trial and error, I learnt how to use my tablet and Flash. I've been making animations the same way ever since.

            My future plans
        </h1>
        <p>
            I hope to edventually either become a full time animator, or a video game artist. I also enjoy composing music so if I make a career out of music I'd be happy as well. Though, I enjoy animation the most and want it to be my primary job.

            Now this is the internet after all, but I can explain at least a little about me. I'm an inspiring animator from Iowa who plans to make a career out of creativity. I don't want to just have a normal job where I work and live out an ordinary life. Once I'd die, there'd be nothing left of me for people to remember. Life would of been really boring. I want to create with my life. I want to be able to create things that will inspire others, give people entertainment, and to leave a mark on the world before I leave. I plan to do this predominantly via animation.
