        A fun, short, and joke of a platformer game made with the sole intent of making my friends laugh.

        You play as Colin; a jean hating and rock loving nerd who you need to help reach the end of the game without killing (despite the ironic name of the game!)

    </h1>
    <p>
        v.1.0 Alpha
    </p>
    <p>
        this version of the game (4/23/2024) includes some minor bug fixes and additions to the base game gameplay. Some of the screens are updated as well. it is also technically the first offical release of the game (yay!)
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">
        *title screen has been updated; minigames menu is added; how to play button is on the title screen now instead of in game; achievements screen has been updated.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">
        *Level three has been updated; the respawn point has been fixed so that you no longer noclip out of the game once you die; proper obstacles have been placed correctly now; the Pizza item has been added (doesn't do anything yet); THIS LEVEL IS NOT FINISHED YET.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">
        *North Korea has been added to the game.
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">
        *Achievements now properly show up when they are supposed to, AND they dissapear after they show up for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would have finished all of the first four levels before uploading, but this game is currently eating away at my sleep schedule. For my academic success updates on the game will be relatively slow.
